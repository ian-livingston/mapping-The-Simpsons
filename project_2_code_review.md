[X] Slides included
[X] Code included

## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Great job using .py files ( please let me know if you're still having trouble importing and using them in your notebooks)
  Loved the efficient name and usage of each function to collect, clean data, and model (**especially this component**)
- Your github looks very professional!! 
- Loved how you used list comprehensions and loops. 

## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md, in the possible impacts section, highlight your scoring metrics instead of the "description" section
- Markdown cells at the beginning of each section helped layout the foundation for upcoming cells. Felt like I was doing the project with you. lol
- Layout of github was clear and concise. You can use folder to lump similar items. E.g. (py files and images) 
- For longer sentences about your data science process via jupyter notebooks use markdown cells instead of inline code lines. 

## Proper Data Science:

- Good workflow from LR > Lasso + Feature Engineering + Feature Reduction
- Feature engineering process was innovative. Think about how you automate some of this code. 
  If you see yourself apply the same methods to different columns (repeating lines of codes), can you write a function insteads.

## Comments:

- Excellent job on project 2! :)
- Loved the organization of your code. 
- Looking forward to future work. As we spoke about this project would be great for NLP (project 4). 
  Here you will be able to apply more data science techniques to analyze text
